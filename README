iflot - connects Flot library to IPython

Yet another small library trying to enhance the IPython experience with great interactive visualization. 
The Flot (http://www.flotcharts.org/) plotting library supports a large number of appealing charts and supports rich javascript interaction and data integration.

This work aims to expose the full Flot API to IPython developers. 
It enhances a previous implmentation by crbates. (https://github.com/crbates/ipython-flot/)

To use the library you should:

1. import iflot

2. Instansiate iflot.Plot()

3. Create a plot placeholder using create_plot_placeholder(). This creates a stub in the notebook that uses a unique name provided by you.

4. Call plot() using the name of the place holder you wish to plot or replace. You may use any option available in the Flot libarary documentation. See the examples below.
